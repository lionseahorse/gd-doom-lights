# Godot Doom-style Light control patterns
If you want to use this in your project, just attach doom_light.gd to your Light3D and change the settings in the editor.

Also includes optional linear interpolation of brightnesses, the original library of default light types, and an easy way to add custom patterns using the same syntax. All characters must be a-z or A-Z (capitalization is ignored).

My first public Github repo!
